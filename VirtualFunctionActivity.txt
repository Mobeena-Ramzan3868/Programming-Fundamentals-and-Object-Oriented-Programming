 of a publication.
From this class derive two classes: book, which adds a page count (type int);
 and a tape, which adds a playing time in minutes (type float). Each of the three classes
 should have a getData() function to get its data from the user at the keyboard 
and a putData() to display the data. isOversized() function



Write a main() program that creates an array of pointers to publication. 
In a loop, ask the user for data about a particular book or tape and use
 new to create an object of type book or tape to hold the data.
 Put the pointer to the object in the array. When the user finished
 entering the data for all books and tapes, display he resulting data
 for all the books and tapes entered, using a for loop and a single statement.






int main()
{
    Publication* ptrPub[100];
    int n = 0;
    char choice;

    do
    {
        cout<<“Book or Tape? (b/t): ”; cin>>choice;
        if(choice == ‘b’)
        { ptrPub[n] = new Book;
        ptrPub[n]->getData();
 }
        else
        {
 ptrPub[n] = new Tape;
 ptrPub[n]->getData();
 }
        n++; cout<<“Enter another? (y/n): ”; cin>>choice;
    } while(choice == 'y’);

    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        ptrPub[i]->putName();
if( ptrPub[i]->isOverSized() )
cout << “   The publication is overSized \n”;
}
   
    cout<<endl;
